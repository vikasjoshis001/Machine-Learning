    <p><b>Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to
            automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning
            focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.</b>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction,
            in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we
            provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or
            assistance and adjust actions accordingly.</b></p>

    <h3 style="color:blue;">Some machine learning methods</h3>
    <h5><b>Machine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised.</b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Supervised machine learning algorithms</b> can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using
            labeled examples to predict future events. Starting from the analysis of a known training dataset, the
            learning algorithm produces an inferred function to make predictions about the output values. The system is
            able to provide targets for any new input after sufficient training. The learning algorithm can also compare
            its output with the correct, intended output and find errors in order to modify the model accordingly.</li><br>
        <li>In contrast, <b>unsupervised machine learning algorithms</b> are used when the information used to train is
            neither classified nor labeled. Unsupervised learning studies how systems can infer a function to describe a
            hidden structure from unlabeled data. The system doesn’t figure out the right output, but it explores the
            data and can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.</li><br>
        <li><b>Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms</b> fall somewhere in between supervised and unsupervised
            learning, since they use both labeled and unlabeled data for training – typically a small amount of labeled
            data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The systems that use this method are able to considerably improve
            learning accuracy. Usually, semi-supervised learning is chosen when the acquired labeled data requires
            skilled and relevant resources in order to train it / learn from it. Otherwise, acquiring unlabeled data
            generally doesn’t require additional resources.</li><br>
        <li><b>Reinforcement machine learning algorithms</b> is a learning method that interacts with its environment by
            producing actions and discovers errors or rewards. Trial and error search and delayed reward are the most
            relevant characteristics of reinforcement learning. This method allows machines and software agents to
            automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context in order to maximize its performance.
            Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn which action is best; this is known as the
            reinforcement signal.</li><br>
